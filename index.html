                            <p>Data-driven HPC applications suffer significant overheads for their fine-grained communication pattern. ARL is a high-throughput RPC system that targets at this kind of data-driven applications. It uses Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to provide powerful expressiveness. It achieves high performance through node-level aggregation, work-stealing, and innovate concurrent data structures. It also provides a flexible programming interface for users to program.</p>
                            <p>Node-level aggregation is the primary idea underlying the ARL system, which aggregates RPC requests sharing the same source and target node and sends them together as one large message. Using this methodology, ARL is able to utilize high bandwidth across cores on the same node to achieve low overhead and high throughput.</p>
                            <p>Work-stealing is another important feature of the ARL system. Every core could execute(steal) inbound RPC requests of other cores on the same target node. In this way, ARL could reduce attentiveness-sensitivity and load imbalance problems.
                            <p>I am the main developer of the ARL system. ARL is developed as a C++ header-only library based on GASNet_EX backend.</p>

                            <p>RDMA and RPC are two primary ways for implementing distributed data structures. In this project, we compared the implementation of distributed data structures using RDMA and RPC. We developed an analytical model to predict the performance of RDMA- and RPC- based data structures based on their constituent operations, and then compared it with real-world performance.</p>
                            <p>My primary focus in this project is to design and conduct experiments to investigate the attentiveness problem of RPC, which became one of the motivations for the later ARL system project.</p>

                            <p>The Berkeley Container Library (BCL) is a distributed data structure library based on RDMA written in C++. Rust is a system programming language for both safety and high performance. We re-designed and implemented BCL using Rust to provide several safety guarantees for the distributed data structures, including data race, memory leaking, type check, and explicit type convert.</p>
                            <p>I was one of the main developers of BCL in Rust. I developed the global pointer based on OpenSHMEM backend, which is the base for high-level data structure and has little overhead compared to the raw backend functions, and the global guard, which prevents data race in reference to the mutex struct in Rust. I also contributed some codes to the distributed Array, GuardArray struct and their benchmarks.</p>

                            <p>As the live video streaming grows rapidly, high-speed data transmission in the open field is increasingly demanding for high-quality video transmission. In this project, we proposed an innovate parallel data transmission system which combines Cellular network with wifi-hotspot to achieve high data transmission bandwidth.</p>
                            <p>Link aggregation is the primary idea underlying this system: the host device uses a Wi-Fi hotspot to connect several relay device. Then it is able to utilize the high bandwidth of Wi-Fi hotpot and transmit data with the Cellular links of all the devices in this system.</p>
                            <p>I developed the high-speed parallel transmission system as a real-world prototype system on the Android platform. I evaluated the system in real-world with 4 GigaBytes data transmission and gained 2.5X bandwidth with 4 devices.</p>

                            <p>PPT is a powerful media to convey ideas and share information in a broad array of scenarios. However, current PPT remote control tools are far from perfect. PPT Ctrl is a mobile application enabling people to control PPT in an interactive way. It has various functions including page switching, highlighting, magnifying, drawing, and real-time computer screen display.</p>
                            <p>I developed this system from scratch in a team of four students as the team leader. The system is based on Qt and Android platform.</p>

                                advised by Prof. <a href="http://icne.sjtu.edu.cn/info/1061/1075.htm">Yi Xu</a>, Apr. 2018 - Oct. 2018 <br></p>
                            <p>Visual video and natural language understanding are two of the main efforts enabling computers to "think like humans". Video clip retrieval by natural language is an interdisciplinary task of these two fields. Its goal is: given a video and a query sentence, find the clip in the video described by the sentence.</p>
                            <p>In this project, we proposed a spatial-textual coattention network to establish the interactions between words and spatial regions. We evaluated our model on the DiDeMo dataset and outperformed state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.</p>

                        I currently believe in rationality and emotional neutrality. I said "currently" because I also believe in lifelong development. Amazed by the beauty in logic and infinite possibility, I chose computer science as my major. Deciding to devote my life to an area I love, I have explored different areas of computer science, namely, artificial intelligence, computer networks, programming languages, and parallel computing in chronological order. In the process of my exploration, I found my interest gradually converging to computer systems and very likely programming languages and parallel computing. I am now applying for CS Ph.D. programs starting in Fall 2020.
